<strong>Project Title:</strong> CV/Resume Generator

<strong>Project Overview:</strong>
This project is a React-based web application that allows users to input their personal, educational, and professional details to generate a formatted CV or résumé. Users can input and submit their information, which is then displayed in a structured format. The project emphasizes core React concepts such as state management, component-based architecture, and props. Users can switch between edit mode and display mode to easily modify their details.

<strong>Technologies and Skills Used:</strong>

<ul>
  <li><strong>React.js:</strong> Managed the component structure, state, and dynamic rendering of the application.</li>
  <li><strong>JavaScript (ES6+):</strong> Handled logic for managing user input, updating state, and passing data between components.</li>
  <li><strong>HTML5:</strong> Structured the application layout and content.</li>
  <li><strong>CSS3:</strong> Styled the application, focusing on a clean and user-friendly interface.</li>
  <li><strong>State Management:</strong> Leveraged React’s useState hook to control form inputs, submission handling, and toggling between edit and display modes.</li>
  <li><strong>Component-Based Design:</strong> Organized the project into reusable components such as GeneralInfo, Education, and WorkExperience.</li>
  <li><strong>Props Handling:</strong> Passed data between parent and child components to maintain consistency across the application.</li>
  <li><strong>Version Control (Git):</strong> Regular commits tracked the development process.</li>
  <li><strong>Deployment:</strong> Deployed the application on a live platform, making it accessible online.</li>
</ul>

  <li><strong>Component Structure:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>The application is divided into modular components under the components directory.</li>

    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Custom Styling:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>A separate styles directory houses the CSS files for the application, allowing for scoped styling within each component.</li>
